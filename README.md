- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatthewHMontalvo

- 🌱 Currently a Master's student in Biotechnology and Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University, I am enthusiastic about delving into the cutting-edge realms of genomic research, immunology, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.

- 💞️ The prospect of advancing my knowledge and honing my skills in this dynamic field excites me beyond measure. I bring a solid foundation to the table with a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Sciences from Texas A&M University. In my experience as a Data Analyst at DHR Health, I've become proficient in tools such as Excel, SQL, PowerBI, and Tableau, I leverage these skills to transform raw data into actionable insights. Feel free to reach out—I'm excited about the journey ahead and the prospect of connecting with inspiring individuals who share my enthusiasm for advancing the field of bioinformatics.

- 👀 I’m interested in personalized medicine and drug discovery within the fields of immunology, oncology, and virology.
